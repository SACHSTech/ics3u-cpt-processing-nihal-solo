# Program Title (edit this)

Put your program description here.


The objective of my game is to try and play for as long as you can to try and get the highest score you possibly can while trying not to run into a car or a truck, off the road, or run out of fuel. If you never crash the game will never end, so there is no specific time limit that you can play the game in. You can use the left and right arrow keys to move your car to try and dodge the other cars and trucks. You are also trying to pick up gas tanks so you don’t run out of fuel. Your fuel amount is located at the top right side of the screen. It says “Fuel: whatever your fuel is %”.  The fuel is rounded so you won’t get a double (which is a decimal) number. Some ways you can die is if you drive off the road, crash into another car or truck, or run out of fuel. You can also press “r” when you die to replay the game so you don’t have to close the window and reopen it all the time. You get ten points when a wave of cars or trucks passes by and reaches the edge of the screen. By a wave, I mean a group, which increases by one car or truck every time your score increases by one hundred points. Your score is displayed at the top left of your screen. It says “Score: whatever you score is”. You also have edge limitations which means you can’t run off the road or else you will die, you can only have a maximum of one hundred percent fuel, and you can’t move up or down in my game.
